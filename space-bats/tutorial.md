## Introduction

This is a tutorial for creating a Space Bats game in
[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).

## Setup

1. Open the [Scratch Editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/) in your
   browser to start with a new project. If you already have a project open, you
   can also use the "File" menu and select "New" to create a new one.

2. Remove the default cat sprite from the project by clicking on the trash
   symbol on `Sprite1`.

   ![Remove the default cat sprite](./images/screenshot_setup_2.webp)

## Create the Game

### Create the Background

1. Click on the existing backdrop "Backdrops1" and select the "Backdrops" tab.

   ![Select the backdrops tab](./images/screenshot_background_1.webp)

2. Create a new backdrop by clicking on the "Choose a Backdrop" button on the
   bottom left and select "Stars" from the list. There is a search field at the
   top, so you can also search for the backdrop.

   ![Create the stars backdrop](./images/screenshot_background_2.webp)

3. Name the new created backdrop "Space" and draw a small gray filled rectangle
   at the bottom to show there is a planet nearby.

   ![Draw a small gray filled rectangle](./images/screenshot_background_3.webp)

4. The initial backdrop "backdrop1" can be removed by clicking on the trash
   symbol.

   ![Remove the backdrop1](./images/screenshot_background_4.webp)

### The Rocketship

#### Create Rocketship

1. Create a new sprite by clicking on the "Choose a Sprite" button and select
   "Rocketship" from the list. There is a search field at the top, so you can
   also search for the sprite.

   ![Create the rocketship sprite](./images/screenshot_rocketship_1.webp)

2. Set the properties of the "Rocketship" sprite to the following values:

   | Property  | Value       |
   | --------- | ----------- |
   | x         | -160        |
   | y         | 120         |
   | Show      | Show sprite |
   | Size      | 30          |
   | Direction | 180         |

   ![Set the properties of the rocketship sprite](./images/screenshot_rocketship_2.webp)

3. Now drag a "when green flag clicked" event block in the Code tab of the
   "Rocketship" sprite.

   ![Add the when green flag clicked event block](./images/screenshot_rocketship_3.webp)

4. Drag and connect the following motion blocks to define the default properties
   of the "Rocketship" sprite to reset it to its initial properties on game
   start:

   | Block              | value |
   | ------------------ | ----- |
   | set x to           | -160  |
   | set y to           | 120   |
   | point in direction | 180   |

   ![Set the default properties of the rocketship sprite](./images/screenshot_rocketship_4.webp)

#### Add Rocketship Movement

1. Rename the existing variable "my variable" in Variables to "Velocity" and add
   a "set [Velocity] to (0)" block.

   | Variable | Value | Description                                                                            |
   | -------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | velocity | 0     | The velocity in pixel at which the rocket falls onto the planet or moves away from it. |

   ![Rename the variable "my variable" to "Velocity"](./images/screenshot_rocketship_movement_1.webp)

   ![Set the set Velocity block](./images/screenshot_rocketship_movement_2.webp)

2. Add a "forever" control block and add a "change y by" motion block. Then move
   the "Velocity" variable into the value field of the "change y by" block.

   | Category | Block                    |
   | -------- | ------------------------ |
   | Control  | "forever"                |
   | Motion   | "change y by [Velocity]" |

   ![Add a forever control block](./images/screenshot_rocketship_movement_3.webp)

   ![Add a change y by motion block](./images/screenshot_rocketship_movement_4.webp)

   ![Add the Velocity variable](./images/screenshot_rocketship_movement_5.webp)

3. Add a second "when green flag clicked" event block with a "forever" control
   block.

   | Category | Block                     |
   | -------- | ------------------------- |
   | Events   | "when green flag clicked" |
   | Control  | "forever"                 |

   ![Add the next blocks](./images/screenshot_rocketship_movement_6.webp)

4. Add a "if < > then else" control block with a "key [space] pressed?" sensing
   block inside the "forever" block.

   | Category | Block                  |
   | -------- | ---------------------- |
   | Control  | "if < > then else"     |
   | Sensing  | "key [space] pressed?" |

   ![Add the next blocks](./images/screenshot_rocketship_movement_7.webp)

5. Inside the "if" part, add a "change [Velocity] by" variable block with a
   value of 1 and in the "else" part add a "change [Velocity] by" variable block
   with a value of -1.

   | Category  | Block                       |
   | --------- | --------------------------- |
   | Variables | "change [Velocity] by (1)"  |
   | Variables | "change [Velocity] by (-1)" |

   ![Add the next blocks](./images/screenshot_rocketship_movement_8.webp)

6. To prevent the rocketship from disappearing from the screen, we limit the
   maximum and minimum y-position of the rocketship sprite.

   | Limits | Value | Description                                                 |
   | ------ | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Max    | 140   | Upper y-position on the screen.                             |
   | Min    | -140  | Lower y-position at which the rocket crashes to the ground. |

   Add two "if < > then" control blocks with the following blocks inside:

   | Category  | Block                 |
   | --------- | --------------------- |
   | Operators | "( ) > (140)"         |
   | Motion    | "y position"          |
   | Variables | "set [Velocity] to 0" |
   | Motion    | "set y to (140)"      |

   | Category  | Block          |
   | --------- | -------------- |
   | Operators | "( ) < (-140)" |
   | Motion    | "y position"   |
   | Control   | "stop [all]"   |

   ![Add two if < > then control blocks](./images/screenshot_rocketship_movement_9.webp)

   Move booth "if < > then" control blocks inside the "forever" block of the
   first "when green flag clicked" block.

   ![Move booth if < > then control blocks](./images/screenshot_rocketship_movement_10.webp)

> [!NOTE]
>
> Now, if you press the green flag, the rocketship should move down and crashes
> to the ground or if space is pressed, it should move up.

### The Space Bat

#### Create Space Bat

1. Create a new sprite by clicking on the "Choose a Sprite" button and select
   "Bat" from the list. Set the following properties of the "Bat" sprite:

   | Property | Value       |
   | -------- | ----------- |
   | Sprite   | Space Bat   |
   | Show     | Hide sprite |

   ![Create the space bat sprite](./images/screenshot_space-bat_1.webp)

2. In the Code tab of the "Bat" sprite, add a "when I start as a clone" control
   block and add the following blocks:

   | Category  | Block                         |
   | --------- | ----------------------------- |
   | Motion    | "set x to (250)"              |
   | Motion    | "set y to ( )"                |
   | Operators | "pick random (-140) to (140)" |
   | Looks     | "set size to (30) %"          |
   | Looks     | "show"                        |

   ![Add the next blocks](./images/screenshot_space-bat_2.webp)

#### Add Space Bat Movement

1. Add the following blocks:

   | Category | Block                              |
   | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
   | Motion   | "glide (10) secs to x:(-250) y:()" |
   | Motion   | "y position"                       |
   | Control  | "delete this clone"                |

   ![Add the space bat movement blocks](./images/screenshot_space-bat_3.webp)

#### Add Space Bat Collision

1. Add a new "when I start as a clone" control block and add the following
   blocks:

   | Category | Block                     |
   | -------- | ------------------------- |
   | Control  | "forever"                 |
   | Control  | "if < > then"             |
   | Sensing  | "touching [Rocketship] ?" |
   | Control  | "stop [all]"              |

   ![Add the space bat collision blocks](./images/screenshot_space-bat_4.webp)

#### Add Space Bat to the Game

1. In the Code tab of the "Rocketship" sprite, add a "when green flag clicked"
   event block and add the following blocks:

   | Category  | Block                    |
   | --------- | ------------------------ |
   | Control   | "forever"                |
   | Control   | "wait ( ) seconds"       |
   | Operators | "pick random (2) to (5)" |
   | Control   | "create clone of [Bat]"  |

   ![Add the space bat to the game](./images/screenshot_space-bat_5.webp)

> [!NOTE]
>
> Now Space Bats appear, which have to be dodged with the Rocketship. If we
> touch one, the game is over.

### Add Points

Every Space Bat that passes the rocketship gives us one point.

1. In the Code tab of the "Space Bat" sprite, in the first "when I start as a
   clone" control block add a "broadcast (message1)" event block. Name the
   message "Point earned".

   | Category | Block                      |
   | -------- | -------------------------- |
   | Events   | "broadcast (Point earned)" |

   ![Add point earned message 1](./images/screenshot_points_1.webp)

   ![Add point earned message 2](./images/screenshot_points_2.webp)

2. In the Code tab of the "Rocketship" sprite, add a new variable "Points" and
   set it to 0.

   | Category  | Block                      |
   | --------- | -------------------------- |
   | Variables | make new variable "Points" |
   | Variables | "set [Points] to (0)"      |

   ![Add points variable](./images/screenshot_points_3.webp)

3. In the Code tab of the "Rocketship" sprite, add a "when I receive [Point
   earned]" event block and change the variable Points by 1:

   | Category  | Block                           |
   | --------- | ------------------------------- |
   | Events    | "when I receive [Point earned]" |
   | Variables | "change [Points] by (1)"        |

   ![Add points update](./images/screenshot_points_4.webp)

> [!NOTE]
>
> Now we can earn points by passing Space Bats.

### Add Animation

1. In the Code tab of the "Rocketship" sprite, add a new "when green flag
   clicked" event block with the following blocks:

   | Category | Block                 |
   | -------- | --------------------- |
   | Control  | "forever"             |
   | Control  | "wait (0.25) seconds" |
   | Looks    | "next costume"        |

   ![Add Rocketship animation](./images/screenshot_animation_1.webp)

   In the Costumes tab remove the "rocketship-e" costume.

   ![Remove not needed Rocketship costume](./images/screenshot_animation_2.webp)

2. In the Code tab of the "Space Bat" sprite, add a new "when I start as a
   clone" control block with the same blocks.

   ![Add Space Bat animation](./images/screenshot_animation_3.webp)

> [!NOTE]
>
> Now the Rocketship and the Space Bats are animated.

## Enhancements

### Add Game Difficulty

1. In the Code tab of the "Rocketship" sprite, add two new variables "Space Bat
   Size" and "Space Bat Speed", set them to 20 and 10 and remove the check
   marks.

   | Category  | Block                               |
   | --------- | ----------------------------------- |
   | Variables | make new variable "Space Bat Size"  |
   | Variables | make new variable "Space Bat Speed" |
   | Variables | "set [Space Bat Size] to (20)"      |
   | Variables | "set [Space Bat Speed] to (10)"     |

   ![Add Space Bat Size and Speed variables](./images/screenshot_difficulty_1.webp)

2. In the "when I receive [Point earned]" event block, add the following blocks:

   | Category  | Block                                |
   | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
   | Control   | "if < > then"                        |
   | Operators | "( ) = (0)"                          |
   | Oprtators | "( ) mod (2)"                        |
   | Variables | "Points"                             |
   | Variables | "change [Space Bat Size] by (5)"     |
   | Control   | "if < > then"                        |
   | Operators | "( ) > (2)"                          |
   | Variables | "Space Bat Speed"                    |
   | Variables | "change [Space Bat Speed] by (-0.5)" |

   ![Add Space Bat Size and Speed changes](./images/screenshot_difficulty_2.webp)

3. In the Code tab of the "Space Bat" sprite, use the "Space Bat Size" and
   "Space Bat Speed" variables.

   ![Use Space Bat   Size and Speed variables](./images/screenshot_difficulty_3.webp)
